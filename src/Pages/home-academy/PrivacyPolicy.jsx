      <h5><b>COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</b></h5>
          <h5>What are cookies and similar technologies?</h5>
          <p>
          We may collect personal information using “cookies”. Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.
We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Site; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers on our Site, and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites or online services.
          </p>
          <h5>Pixel tags</h5>
<p>We may also use technologies that function similarly to cookies called pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) to track the actions of users on our Site. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages. Pixel tags can be used, for example, to measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Site, so that we can better understand how users interact with our Site.</p>
<h5>How we use cookies and similar technologies</h5>
<p>Our Site may collect personal information using the following types of cookies and similar technologies and process that data for the purposes set out below:
Essential Cookies
These cookies and similar technologies are essential to provide you with services available through our Site and to enable you to use some of its features (e.g., to keep you logged in as you navigate between web pages). Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.
These cookies and similar technologies collect personal information, such as unique IDs, IP addresses, device information, OS/browser type, and other similar data, that are used to create information about traffic to our Site and how users use our Site. The information gathered may include the number of visitors to our Site, the websites that referred them to our Site, the pages they visited on our Site, what time of day they visited our Site, whether they have visited our Site before, and other similar information.
Analytics and Performance Cookies
We use this information to help operate our Site more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Site.
For example, we use Google Analytics to improve how our Site works, so that we can understand usage patterns on the Site, and similar purposes. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies here and about how Google protects your data here. You can prevent the use of Google Analytics relating to your use of our Site by downloading and installing the browser plugin available here. To learn more about other similar technologies we use and how you can opt out, you may contact us.con
Social Media Cookies
These cookies and similar technologies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or “like” button on our Site or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook or Twitter. The social network will record that you have done this and may collect additional personal information about you or link it to other personal information they hold about you, as described further by the social media service. Please see the applicable privacy policy for more detail.
Retargeting Interest-based Advertising
These cookies and similar technologies are used for “retargeting” and for interest-based advertising.
Interest-based advertising includes various parties and services providers, including third party data controllers, engaged in the processing of personal data in connection with personalized advertising. These parties may collect personal information such as unique IDs, IP addresses, device information, OS/browser type, and other similar data, as well as information about the ads you see and view to develop and assess aspects of a profile about you to deliver more relevant advertisements and offers and determine whether and how ads you see are effective. These third parties may augment your profile with demographic and other preferences data derived from these observations, and may also track whether you view, interact with, or how often you have seen an ad, or whether you complete a purchase for a good or services you were shown in an advertisement. These parties may be able to identify you across sites, devices, and over time.
We also use ad “retargeting” so that you can see advertisements from us on other websites. For example, we may share with Google certain personal information (such as unique user ID) in connection with advertising provided through Google’s “Customer Match” Service. These technologies and the data they process may be used by advertisers to deliver ads on their services based on content you have viewed on our Sites, or that we believe you would be interested in, for example, based on Events you have attended or products/services you have purchased from us. These tracking technologies may also help prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and help us understand whether you have interacted with or viewed ads we’ve delivered to you. This collection and ad targeting takes place both on our Sites and on third-party websites (e.g., Google) that participate in the ad network, e.g., any advertisements delivered by that ad network on a third-party website.
To learn about the specific providers, we use for these services, please contact us.</p>
<h5>For online advertising</h5>
<p>We use may use Device/Network Data and Inference Data we collect from cookies and similar technologies in order to market certain products and services to you, such as Events you may be interested in. For example, if you attend an Event, we may use your personal data in connection with online advertising campaigns on Google, Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn. We, or our third-party advertising partners, may combine this information in order to create profiles that are used to make more relevant profiles. You can control how these third parties use your data, and the ads you see on these platforms, using the tools described in the Your Rights and Choices section below.</p>
<h5>With your consent</h5>
<p>We may use or share your personal information with your consent, such as when you: consent to participate in additional surveys on gender and race/ethnicity (where legally permissible), let us post your testimonials or endorsements on our Sites, instruct us to take a specific action with respect to your personal information, or opt into third party marketing communications.
Please note, in certain cases (such as in connection with our Diversity & Inclusion efforts), we may collect and share with parties you authorize, information about race, ethnic origin, religious beliefs, physical/mental health, sexual orientation, or other personal information that is classified as a “special category” of personal data under applicable law. You may revoke your consent to this processing at any time. Additional information regarding these programs, how your personal information will be shared, and the parties that may receive it, are available within program descriptions we provided at the time you agreed to participate in the program.</p>

<p>We use your personal information as we believe necessary or appropriate to (a) enforce the terms and conditions that govern the Service; (b) protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of you or others; and (c) protect, investigate and deter against fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized, unethical or illegal activity.</p>
<h5>To create aggregated or de-identified information</h5>
<p>We may disclose or use aggregated or de-identified information for any purpose, subject to limits under applicable law.

      <h5><b>SECURITY</b></h5>
      <p>
        The security of your personal information is important to us. We take a
        number of organizational, technical and physical measures designed to
        protect the personal information we collect, both during transmission
        and once we receive it. However, no security safeguards are 100% secure
        and we cannot guarantee the security of your information.

        party websites or services and are not responsible for their actions.
        Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or
